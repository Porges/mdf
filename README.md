This is a GEDCOM parser that got out of hand.

The various crates are:

- `mdf`: the top-level tool for dealing with GEDCOM files
- `gedcomfy`: the GEDCOM parser & schemas itself
- `gedcomesque`: SQL types for GEDCOM
- `errful`: supplementary information for errors (like `miette`)
- `complex_indifference`: typed numeric types
